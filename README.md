### Proposed Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (Conv Net) is a special category of neural 
network architectures that takes an image as input, assigns importance to distinct 
aspects in the image, and can distinguish between them [9], [5]. They have made 
significant progress toward improved image classification performance. The 
proposed model exploited various state-of-the-art CNN models for classification 
such as InceptionV3, Resnet50V2, and Efficient Net b7 for extracting features. 
The high-dimensional nature of the transfer learned deep features produced from 
multiple deep convolutional models could have a negative impact on the 
classification model. This unveils the limitation of this study. High-level features 
obtained from the final FC layer of the aforementioned deep learning models are 
then fed into machine learning models to analyze how well the ML models are 
performing on the deep learning features. The workflow of the proposed model is 
shown in Figure.
